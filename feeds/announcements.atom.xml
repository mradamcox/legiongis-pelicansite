We have spent the last week mercilessly making improvements and changes. For example, we created the &lt;a href="embedding-web-maps-in-these-blog-posts.html"&gt;map post&lt;/a&gt;, which will make it very easy for us to share mappy information about our projects. You may also notice an update to our "Team" page (now called "background")...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September, we (technically "we" could say "I" at this point) watched as Brendan began school at the UW-Madison, and the LLC partnership became an LLC sole proprietorship. Legion GIS owes a lot to Brendan; he was instrumental in all of our summer projects, and continues to be a great resource as we finish our karst-geology related work with the Crawford Stewardship Network and a splendid bike map of Vernon County. Also, he made that great banner image on our home page (perhaps he can write a guest blog post about it someday!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Brendan heads to school, Adam has headed south and brought the business with him. This is, as hinted at earlier in the year, the commencement of Phase 2. That's why we have a new logo. We have engaged the thrusters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for business news, we will be co-presenting at the Association for Preservation Technology conference in San Antonio this coming week about our work on Arches with PRESERVE/scapes. This will be followed-up in 2017 with co-authorship of an article in the APTi bulletin, an exciting opportunity. We also have big plans to retro-actively post about our work over the last year. We've done quite a few projects, each one a little different from the last, each with its own challenges. So, stay tuned, and thanks for checking in!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="announcements"></category></entry><entry><title>Our Website Is Up &amp; Running</title><link href="http://legiongis.com/our-website-is-up-running.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-02-25T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2016-02-25T00:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Legion GIS Team</name></author><id>tag:legiongis.com,2016-02-25:/our-website-is-up-running.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h3&gt;Hello!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After many hours of wrangling, configuring, contemplating, reconfiguring, and retemplating (!) we are ready to launch our website. You could call it a pre-branding, as the format and lack of logo could stand some attention, but overall we're pretty happy with it. In the future we'll also write about how we're generating and hosting this site, but first things first: &lt;strong&gt;Thank you for checking out our new business!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Legion GIS, LLC is a small member-managed partnership adventure. If you look at our &lt;a href="pages/services.html"&gt;services&lt;/a&gt; page, you'll see that collaboration and knowledge-sharing are integral to our mission, and we mean that on many levels. In the future you can look forward to blog posts not only about maps, web development, and spatial data, but also accounting, history, and maybe even taxes if we're in the mood. Definitely some actual &lt;em&gt;fun&lt;/em&gt; stuff too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'd like to think of this as the beginning of Phase 1. Through collaboration with the wonderful &lt;a href="http://www.kickapoovsn.org/"&gt;Valley Stewardship Network&lt;/a&gt;, we've been granted the opportunity to embed our office within a new endeavor of their own: a citizen-oriented GIS resource center located in downtown Viroqua, Wisconsin. Our presence in the new space on Main St. will help the VSN get their vision off the ground, and will give us the best environment possible to test our instructive and facilitative capacity. Much more about that to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phase 2 is will begin at the end of the summer, when we expect to find ourselves hurtling toward a multitude of new Opportunities and Explorations. More on that to come as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After working as independent contractors, we are both very excited to be a &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; business.  We even have a checkbook, and have plans to buy an embosser with our logo on it, once we have a logo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, before you leave, be sure to learn a little about the services we offer, which is where you can also take a look at some of our team's past work. And, most of all, please &lt;a href="pages/contact.html"&gt;get in touch&lt;/a&gt; with us! We are always happy to get your feedback, questions, and random thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to see you coming back,&lt;/p&gt;
