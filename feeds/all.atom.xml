We have spent the last week mercilessly making improvements and changes. For example, we created the &lt;a href="embedding-web-maps-in-these-blog-posts.html"&gt;map post&lt;/a&gt;, which will make it very easy for us to share mappy information about our projects. You may also notice an update to our "Team" page (now called "background")...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September, we (technically "we" could say "I" at this point) watched as Brendan began school at the UW-Madison, and the LLC partnership became an LLC sole proprietorship. Legion GIS owes a lot to Brendan; he was instrumental in all of our summer projects, and continues to be a great resource as we finish our karst-geology related work with the Crawford Stewardship Network and a splendid bike map of Vernon County. Also, he made that great banner image on our home page (perhaps he can write a guest blog post about it someday!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Brendan heads to school, Adam has headed south and brought the business with him. This is, as hinted at earlier in the year, the commencement of Phase 2. That's why we have a new logo. We have engaged the thrusters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for business news, we will be co-presenting at the Association for Preservation Technology conference in San Antonio this coming week about our work on Arches with PRESERVE/scapes. This will be followed-up in 2017 with co-authorship of an article in the APTi bulletin, an exciting opportunity. We also have big plans to retro-actively post about our work over the last year. We've done quite a few projects, each one a little different from the last, each with its own challenges. So, stay tuned, and thanks for checking in!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="announcements"></category></entry><entry><title>Embedding Web Maps In These Blog Posts</title><link href="http://legiongis.com/embedding-web-maps-in-these-blog-posts.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-10-26T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2016-10-26T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Adam Cox</name></author><id>tag:legiongis.com,2016-10-26:/embedding-web-maps-in-these-blog-posts.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;One thing I've been polishing up is a method for including a stock web map within the body of one of these blog posts. This …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One thing I've been polishing up is a method for including a stock web map within the body of one of these blog posts. This would allow for a quick and easy way to share some news about current projects, along with the map layers that we're using or producing. I'd begun working on this a while ago, and have figured out a method that is 90% satisfactory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This site is generated by Pelican, which means that an article (blog post) like this one is written in markdown and then passed through an html Jinja template, "article.html", which formats it and results in a static "embedding-web-maps-in-these-blog-posts.html" file. In a few cases I had made standalone web maps in new individual templates "map-article1.html", "map-article2.html", etc. However, these new templates would necessarily be exact copies of "article.html", plus a few added lines of html to make the map at the bottom. This kind of replication doesn't feel good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One challenging thing about making a one-size-fits-all web map template is that even though the design can maintain a uniform look, labeling the buttons, info boxes, and configuring the layers themselves requires a considerable amount of modification from one map to the next. This means that a stock "map-article.html" template--to which a list of layers, layer information, button names, etc. could be passed--is out of the question, at least for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I've ended up doing instead is a combination of standalone web map templates and the original "article.html" template. I created a new folder, "templates/maps", into which I've placed the html for each map. Then, I add that html file's name to the article's metadata. Finally, that html is incorporated into the "article.html" after the article's content is displayed with this statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;article.content&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cp"&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="x"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="cp"&gt;{%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;article.maphtml&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cp"&gt;%}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="x"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="x"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;{%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;article.maphtml&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cp"&gt;%}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="x"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="cp"&gt;{%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;endif&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cp"&gt;%}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="x"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Including nice-looking maps at the bottom of blog posts is now pretty easy. I just have to go into the maps/templates folder, copy and paste an existing template, and add/remove buttons, layers, etc. This allows for a lot of flexibility with a relatively small amount of effort. The final touch is to copy these map templates staight to the website output, so the maps can be viewed on their own individual pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A note about the design itself: This web map format is just an adaptation of my very first foray into using Open Layers 3 and GeoServer. I have made some basic updates to make the maps (a little) more mobile friendly and to use this website's css, and rewritten the html to use bootstrap. Otherwise, as you can see, it's very simple.&lt;/p&gt;

The Wisconsin Geology and Natural History Survey (WGNHS) stores digital archives of all WCRs for wells created before 1989. These come in the form of PDFs, which, though generally legible and full of information, are hard to use for any large scale analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to pull relevant information from these reports (of which there are 1,136 in Crawford County) we set up an interface through which volunteers were able to view each image and easily enter certain pieces of information gleaned from the document. We spent a lot of time working with the Crawford Stewardship Project to discern which specific information should be gathered, knowing that there was a fine balance to strike between asking too much of the volunteers, and getting too little information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After our first 2 hours of effort, we pulled data from 886 of the 1,136 (78%), leaving only 250. More folks pitched in the following day to finish everything up. You can view the full response spreadsheet &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RdV2OxA6jlCYrHaBD7waGpBJ2_SxZtZP8-NHfOKZe3U/edit#gid=289827408"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, or check out the chart below for a summary of the information we gathered (percentages are out of 1,136).&lt;/p&gt;

Which basemaps? Where will the aerial imagery come from? Can historic maps be included as overlays? To test all these things out, I generally make a light-weight webmap that can serve as a testing ground. Below is the result of the development of the AFRH Arches app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, there are suitable basemap layers out there somewhere. In this case, we used open street map's default tile rendering for the street map, and a 2013 aerial photograph tileset published by DCGIS for the imagery. (In an earlier iteration, we used MapQuest tiles which was great because they had a separate "labels" layer that we grouped with the imagery to make a very nice-looking hybrid layer. Then MapQuest discontinued their tile service. Bummer.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more interesting part of the process is always the creation of the historic map layers. Legion GIS was provided with 12 high resolution scans of these maps, ranging in date from 1850 to 1975, and then the fun begins. Full details on our favorite image processing techniques are for another post, but through some GIMP processing, ArcGIS/QGIS georeferencing, and GDAL resampling we are able to create nice, as-light-weight-as-possible GeoTiffs. These are published as Web Map Services through GeoServer, and the result is shown below.&lt;/p&gt;

This can be achieved with a graceful integration of some solid open source technologies that Arches is primed to handle. Functionally, wouldn't it be great to edit your vector layers in Quantum GIS, and have the updates immediately visible in your Arches overlays?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, here are my thoughts: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/legiongis.com/img/qgis-geoserver-postgis-arches.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="what's going on" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/legiongis.com/img/qgis-geoserver-postgis-arches.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;em&gt;I'm using :XX where a port must be open to allow the appropriate connections. (It's pretty slick to re-route GeoServer to run through port :80 (instead of :8080) with all your other HTTP requests, but that's a detail beyond our needs here...)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, narratively: Store your vector overlays in your existing PostGIS installation, and they can be directly edited there with QGIS (because it has great PostGIS support). These same tables can simultaneously published (and styled) by GeoServer as layers, which in turn can be fed to your custom app, and show up in the map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elements of this setup are already built into Arches, as you can read about &lt;a href="http://arches-hip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/loading-data/#optional-gis-layers-for-administrative-areas"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. There is already an "aux" schema within your app's PostGIS database, and with a little configuration you can create polygons whose name will be attributed to any newly created intersecting resource. This is a nice functionality, so you may want to use the following steps to just connect directly to these tables. The steps below will also cover the creation of a new database to hold your overlay tables, outside of the existing app db.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I followed these steps on an example Arches v3 installation. So in my case "Remote Server" is an Amazon EC2 instance (running Ubuntu), "Local Computer" is my laptop with QGIS on it, and "Client (Browser)" is anybody looking at the website. To follow along you must have some sort of similar setup (or at least can fill in the blanks where necessary), and you must have a running GeoServer instance on your server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;SSH into your server, and create a new db to hold your tables&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is only if you want to create tables that are outside of your app's existing database. If you need to do reinstallations of your app, you may want to do follow this step because your app's database will be dropped and recreated blank on every reinstallation. If you want to make tables in the existing database, just skip to the next section (and substitute the database name accordingly).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once logged onto the server, use these commands to make the db:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;~$ psql -U postgres
postgres=# CREATE DATABASE arches_overlays;
postgres=# \connect arches_overlays
postgres=# CREATE EXTENSION postgis;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's all the SQL you need (though you could do most of the next step with SQL if you want). Use &lt;code&gt;\q&lt;/code&gt; to quit the psql console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Connect to the db with QGIS to make/edit the tables&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open QGIS, and begin by creating a connection to the db&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;You'll need to make sure you can get to your server through port :5432 for this step, which may mean firewall configuration (this is &lt;a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/GettingStartedGuide/getting-started-create-security-group.html"&gt;super easy&lt;/a&gt; on AWS)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open the "Add PostGIS Layer" dialog, click "New", and enter the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Name = arches overlay db (or whatever you want)&lt;br&gt;
Host = your IP address&lt;br&gt;
Port = 5432&lt;br&gt;
Database = arches_overlays&lt;br&gt;
Username = postgres&lt;br&gt;
Password = postgis&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;this is the default username/password combo for a new Arches installation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click "Test Connection", and once you get it working click "Ok".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are going to use the existing "aux" schema tables in your app database, just find and add these now. You should see "parcels", "overlays", and "addresses". Be sure to refer back to the official Arches &lt;a href="http://arches-hip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/loading-data/#optional-gis-layers-for-administrative-areas"&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt; if you're doing this. When you're done editing in QGIS, just skip to the GeoServer section below.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Otherwise, close the dialog box, and continue with steps 4-6.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, go to &lt;em&gt;Database &amp;gt; DB Manager &amp;gt; DB Manager&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expand the PostGIS tab, expand your database, and go to &lt;em&gt;Table &amp;gt; Create Table&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I made a simple polygon table, so my dialog looked like this:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/legiongis.com/img/make_postgis_table_qgis.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="create table dialog" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/legiongis.com/img/make_postgis_table_qgis.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now that your table exists, you can add it as a PostGIS layer and begin to edit it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Re-open the "Add PostGIS Layer" dialog, and re-connect to your database.  You'll now be able to select the new table, and use all the normal QGIS editing tools to add features to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Add your tables to GeoServer as PostGIS data sources&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Log into your GeoServer instance, go to the "Stores" page, and click "Add new data source".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choose "PostGIS" under Vector Data Sources, and enter the information necessary to connect to your database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now use &lt;code&gt;localhost&lt;/code&gt; for the Host, because GeoServer and PostGIS are running on the same server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be sure to enter the name of your PostGIS database&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll now be able to publish any tables in your database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most of the information is already ready, but be sure to at least compute the bounding boxes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you can style the layers all you like with GeoServer's SLD support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Add your GeoServer layers as overlays in your Arches app&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the easy part. All you need to do is open your layers file, found here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;/hipapp/hipapp/media/js/map/layers.js&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and make a new layer object that uses your GeoServer layer for the source. The relevant portion of your javascript will look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;layer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ol&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;layer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;Tile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;source&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ol&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;source&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;TileWMS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;http://XX.XX.XX.XX:8080/geoserver/workspacename/wms/&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;params&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;LAYERS&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;workspacename:layername&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;TILED&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;serverType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;geoserver&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;}),&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;}),&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full instructions on how to add overlays to your layers.js file can be found &lt;a href="http://arches-hip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/customization/#overlays"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; in the official Arches-HIP documention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a lot of steps, but if you live in fantasy-land and don't run into any issues, it shouldn't take more than half an hour or so. And if you can get it to work once, the next time it will be more or less effortless.&lt;/p&gt;

Definitely some actual &lt;em&gt;fun&lt;/em&gt; stuff too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'd like to think of this as the beginning of Phase 1. Through collaboration with the wonderful &lt;a href="http://www.kickapoovsn.org/"&gt;Valley Stewardship Network&lt;/a&gt;, we've been granted the opportunity to embed our office within a new endeavor of their own: a citizen-oriented GIS resource center located in downtown Viroqua, Wisconsin. Our presence in the new space on Main St. will help the VSN get their vision off the ground, and will give us the best environment possible to test our instructive and facilitative capacity. Much more about that to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phase 2 is will begin at the end of the summer, when we expect to find ourselves hurtling toward a multitude of new Opportunities and Explorations. More on that to come as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After working as independent contractors, we are both very excited to be a &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; business.  We even have a checkbook, and have plans to buy an embosser with our logo on it, once we have a logo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, before you leave, be sure to learn a little about the services we offer, which is where you can also take a look at some of our team's past work. And, most of all, please &lt;a href="pages/contact.html"&gt;get in touch&lt;/a&gt; with us! We are always happy to get your feedback, questions, and random thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to see you coming back,&lt;/p&gt;
